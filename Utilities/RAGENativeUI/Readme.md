[5-SEPT-2015] Stealth22 - Created an Elements namespace, and separated the code out a bit. But its still quite a mess, and there are a TON of syntax errors and missing classes still.
But at the very least, this is a starting point we can work from.

[6-SEPT-2015] alexguirre - Created Scaleform class and updated Container.Draw().

[7-SEPT-2015] alexguirre - Updated InstructionalButton class: changed GTA.Control to Rage.GameControl and fixed GetButtonId()
